I fell in love with [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/), and it didn't take me long to start experimenting and creating custom workflows. When [John Lindquist](http://johnlindquist.com/) showed me how he goes about creating them in [JavaScript and Node](https://johnlindquist.com/posts/automation), there were no more excuses.

I work with icons a lot, be it in code or Sketch. I've been using [NucleoApp](https://nucleoapp.com/) for managing my libraries, which works great, and I ended up using it to export a JSON file that I used for the workflow. And since we've started using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) at work, it made sense to use Hero Icons, an MIT licensed set of icons created by [Steve Schoger](https://twitter.com/steveschoger).

Here's the workflow in action:
