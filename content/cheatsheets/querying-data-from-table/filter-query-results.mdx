Use the where `keyword` to add a condition:

```sql
select * from ${TableName} where 
${column_name} = 'value';
```

Logical operators can be added to filter further:

`and` `or` `>` `>=` `<` `=<` `=`  all work as expected.

To find null values, we use `is null` because an <br/> `= null` will return null itself (instead of true or false)

`between` is used as a short hand for:

```sql
condition 1 < data you want < condition 2 select * from Users where create_date between '2018-05-01' and '2018-09-24';
```
