title: Run a Query within another Query (subquery)

For example, to find the `create_date` and `first_name`
of the User who was added first, we would write:

```sql
select create_date, first_name from Users where create_date = (
  select min(create_date) from Users
);
```

This matches the filter from our inner query to the filter on our outer query.
