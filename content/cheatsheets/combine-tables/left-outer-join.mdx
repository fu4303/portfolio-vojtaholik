Take all rows of the table referenced to the left of “left outer join” and match it up with the rows from the table to the right of “left outer join”.

<CodeWithExample>

```sql
select * from ${TableA} aliasToA left outer join ${TableB} aliasToB on ${a.column_name} = ${b.column_name};
```

```qsl
select * from Users u left outer join Purchases p on u.user_handle = p.userhandle;
```

</CodeWithExample>

Results in data showing all users, with blank values for those without Purchase records.
