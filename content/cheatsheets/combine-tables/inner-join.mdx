title: Inner Join
---

import CodeWithExample from '../../../src/components/code-with-example'

The opposite of “full outer join”, this will return only data that is matched across both tables. 
<br/><br/>

<CodeWithExample>

<div/>

```qsl
select * from Users u inner join Purchases 
p on u.user_handle = p.userhandle;
```

</CodeWithExample>

Results in data showing only users who have Purchase records.
